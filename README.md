# Lecture Notes of 14 Lectures on Visual SLAM:  From Theory to Practice

by Xiang Gao, Tao Zhang, Qinrui Yan and Yi Liu

This is repo is forked from the author's github: [code](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook2)

I followed the lecture and wrote all the exercise notes myself.

My implementation is listed under the folder `exercise`.

## [2. Eigen Library](exercise/ch3_eigen)

### [2.1 Use Eigen](exercise/ch3_eigen/useEigen)

Demonstrates the basic operations of Eigen Matrix including initialize, edit values, transpose, multiplication, sum, trace, inverse and determinant.

### [2.2 Use Geometry](exercise/ch3_eigen/useGeometry)

Demonstrates utilizing `Eigen/Geometry` for rotation and transition.  Practice the transformation between Euler, Affine and Quaternion.

### [2.3 Coordinate Transform](exercise/ch3_eigen/coordinateTransform)

A small example to demonstrate the coordinate transformation.

## [5. Cameras and Images](exercise/ch5_cameras_and_images)

### [5.1 Image Basics](exercise/ch5_cameras_and_images/imageBasics)

Demonstrates basic operations of OpenCV.  Also implement the undistortion algorithm by myself with rad-tan parameters.
